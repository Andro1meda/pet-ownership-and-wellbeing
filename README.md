## *Project Overview* ࿔˚⋆
This project demonstrates data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, and visual storytelling using UK public datasets to investigate associations between pet ownership and mental well-being.

_*This project was completed independently outside of formal coursework_


## *What this project demonstrates*࿔˚⋆
- End-to-end data analysis using real-world public datasets
- Data cleaning and standardisation across multiple sources
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modelling
- Translating analytical findings into policy- and stakeholder-relevant insights

## *Research Aim* ࿔˚⋆
To examine the relationship between pet ownership and mental health and well-being at both the individual and population levels in the UK


## *Research Questions* ࿔˚⋆
**_Individual-Level Dataset_**
- RQ1: Do cats or dogs differentially predict anxiety and depression symptoms at the individual level?
- RQ2:  What is the relationship between suicidal behaviours and pet ownership?**

✦ ───────── ✦ ───────── ✦

**_Population-Level Dataset_**
- RQ3: Are regional levels of cat and dog ownership associated with population well-being across UK districts?
- RQ4: How do cats and dogs differ in their patterns of association with population well-being outcomes at the regional level?

## *Analytical Workflow* ࿔˚⋆
1. Collected and validated multi-source public datasets
2. Cleaned and standardised pet ownership rates per capita
3. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Built regression models to assess associations
5. Visualised and interpreted findings for non-technical audiences
